    Real Estate Price Prediction

Introduction:
The real estate industry is experiencing rapid changes due to new technology and an influx of capital. This capital increase should serve as a signal that the real estate industry is preparing to undergo rapid changes with the creation of new digital resources.
Wrong Rumors from different state agents are nowadays coming to grab people's money just for their commission. The real estate problem was resolved to some extent. Now people are able to get a predictable price of their real estate properties and those who are investing, it will be beneficial for them.
An AI based Real Estate Price Prediction project, in which we take into  dataset of 13000 records, with the help of Machine Learning. The project is predicting the price of any particular area by keeping in view how the prices are in the past also by location, square foot, bath, BHK (bedrooms-halls-kitchen) size.

Technology Used:
Domain : Machine Learning (Supervised)
Implemented via python on jupyter notebook

Libraries used:
⦁	Numpy
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
⦁	Pandas
Pandas is another ML open-source data analysis library for Python. It focuses on data analysis and data manipulation. For machine learning programmers who want effortless working with structured multidimensional and time-series data, Pandas is the ML library they need.
⦁	Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
